## Description
This is fullstack side of the Blind Vacation app. 

What is a Blind Vacation app?  
This is solving the problem of a person who wants to plan a vacation but doesn't have enough time.  Through our quick survey, we will plan out a trip (from location to activities to lodging) and return a full itinerary to the user of a trip they can go on.  This saves the user time that they don't have planning their own vacation.

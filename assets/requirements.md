# Blind Vacation Software Requirements
## Vision
We hope to utilize our product to plan a vacation for our users when they want to travel and have a great vacation but need some suggestions on where to go and what activities to do. Our product helps users decide on a vacation destination and plan a thorough trip based on the survey questions we provide to them. The survey questions allow us to know what the users like and do not like about a trip. Based on the answers, we propose a vacation destination, activities the users can do at the destination, and lodging information for our users.
## Scope(In/Out)
### In:
* The web app allows the users to take a survey questionnaire to help them decide on where to go for their vacation, what to do there, and where to stay.
* The web app will propose a vacation destination based on the user's answers to the survey questions.
* The web app will provide a couple of activities that users can do while they enjoy their vacation at the destination.
* The web app will provide a lodging option at the destination based on the user’s budget.
* The web app allows users to save trip results.
### Out:
Our app will only be proposing vacation destinations, activities, and lodging options to the users. No other trip planning services will be provided such as transportation information around the destination.
## MVP
We plan to build a web app that meets the minimum requirements listed below: 
* The web app asks users 5 survey questions to help plan a trip for our users.
* The web app decides on a vacation destination for our users.
* The web app proposes a lodging option that meets the user’s budget.
* The web app selects 2 activities the users can do at the destination.
* The web app allows the users to save the trip results and they can review them whenever they visit this web app again.
## Stretch Goals
We aim to propose these features as our stretch goals:
* The web app allows the users to make modifications to their saved trips and make a customized version of the trip on their own. The users can choose different activities to do that are available at the destination.
* The web app proposes 5 activities the users can do at the destination.
* The web app asks 10 survey questions to the users to better understand their likes and refine the trip results.
* The web app proposes 3 lodging options for users to choose from.
* The web app proposes 3 vacation destinations and 3 sets of trip results for the users to choose from.
## Functional Requirements

* A user can retake the survey questions multiple times to generate different trip results based on their answers to the survey questions. 
* A user can save the trip result to their favorites and be able to review them whenever they visit the web app again.
## Non-Functional Requirements
* Deployment: In order for users to use this web app, we will deploy this web app to the general public on Azure. The web app can be accessed by everyone everywhere.
* Usability: The web app will be built to be straightforward and easy to use for our users. The users can easily navigate through the web app using the navigation bar on the top of the page and be able to take a five-questions survey to get a vacation plan tailored to the user’s needs. The page layout will be designed to be easy to read, and allows the users to effectively utilize the web app to plan their trips with satisfaction.
